Goal of this folder is to successfully install the snakemake package.

You will test the package by running `snakemake --cores 2` from the command line. Notice if you run it now it breaks.

Once you create your environment, `pip install pysam ==0.22` and update the environment.yaml.

Rerun the `snakemake` command and now it works!
